#mapping_set_title: Mapping of MP terms to HPO terms from KidsFirst list									
#mapping_set_description: "HPO terms were provided by the KidsFirst team from the set of terms used for patients in their cohorts. Initially the mapping date was not tracked so these were given the date of when we recieved the file (5/27/21). The set of HPO terms was updated on 5/17/212. Use of skos mappings terms: exact match: MP term is the same as the HPO term, ignoring that the HP term applies only to humans; broad match: MP term covers more than the HPO term; narrow match: MP term is more restircted than the HPO term, ignoring the species restriction; related match: MP term and HPO term share some similarity but would not have a parent-child relation in a shared ontology"

There may be some distinction I'm missing as the HPO has a term for ""Duplication of renal pelvis"" (HP:0005580) but it is unclear to me how this is distinct from duplicated collecting system. I'm guessing that the pelvis includes parts that are not part of the collecting system? Uberon has a term for renal collecting system (UBERON:0004100) defined as collecting duct system of the kidney consists of a series of tubules and ducts that connect the nephrons to the ureter and this has no connection to the renal pelvis and calyx.
